## Code to reproduce the results in the paper

- The fun.R file defines a set of functions that are used in the analysis and simulations. This file is sourced in each of the subsequent scripts.
- The sim.R file runs the simulated data examples, and summarizes the results in figures and tables.
- The analysis.R file runs the read data analysis. The data come from the ivtools package, which can be installed from CRAN.
